      Nadeko is a young girl with dark brown hair and chocolate brown eyes. She is 153 cm(5'0") and her weight is around 38 kg. During the times when she was still cursed by the jagirinawa, her outfit consisted of a waist pouch, an orange newsboy cap, a pink blouse, an orange jacket and a pair of baggy denims â€” all of which were designed to hide the scars that covered her body. She also always casts her eyes downward, with long fringes covering her eyes. It can be assumed that her newsboy cap represents the "snake" that cursed her, as its shape resembles a snake's head.

      She later changes her style to a more comfortable set of clothes after being relieved of the curse, and she shows a preference to wearing skirts.

      Later in the series, she cuts her hair short.
